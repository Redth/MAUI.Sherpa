## 🏔️ v0.5.0-beta.2 — "Tightening the Ropes"

Camp II is set, the icefall is behind us, and the team's taking a moment to check every knot and clip before pushing higher. This quick stop tightens up the provisioning profile experience, fixes a toolbar glitch on first launch, and upgrades the Linux base camp with proper packaging.

### ✨ Improvements

- **Certificate Sync Status in Edit Profile** — The Edit Profile dialog now shows sync status badges (Synced, Local, Cloud, No Key) on each certificate card, so you know exactly which signing identities have their private keys secured before regenerating a profile.
- **Bundle ID on Profile Cards** — Provisioning profiles now display their associated bundle identifier(s) on both the main profile list and the edit dialog — no more guessing which profile belongs to which app.
- **Linux Packaging via GTK4 0.4.0** — Upgraded to Platform.Maui.Linux.Gtk4 v0.4.0 with built-in MSBuild targets for AppImage, Deb, and Flatpak packaging. The Linux base camp now ships in proper containers.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Toolbar Icons Missing on First Launch** — Fixed a race condition on macOS where toolbar icons wouldn't render until navigating away and back. The gear is now laid out correctly from the moment you arrive at camp.

### 🔧 Infrastructure

- **CI Linux Packaging** — GitHub Actions workflow updated to build AppImage, Deb, and Flatpak artifacts for Linux releases alongside macOS and Windows builds.
