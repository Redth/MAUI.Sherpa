## 🏔️ v0.5.0 — "Crossing the Icefall"

The team just rappelled into the biggest stretch of the expedition so far. Three new platforms, a completely rebuilt Copilot experience, live device monitoring on the dashboard, push project management, and a native macOS app that finally feels at home on the mountain. This release is a proper icefall crossing — technical, ambitious, and covering a lot of vertical ground.

### 🆕 New Features

- **Native macOS (AppKit) App** — A fully native macOS head project with NSToolbar, NSSplitView sidebar, window/sidebar persistence, and platform-native search filtering. No more Mac Catalyst pretending to be a Mac app — this one has real crampons.
- **Linux GTK App** — MAUI Sherpa now runs on Linux via a GTK4 head project with a native HeaderBar toolbar, dark mode support via GSettings monitoring, and full feature parity with the Blazor UI.
- **Copilot Native Modal** — The Copilot chat has been lifted out of its inline Blazor overlay into a dedicated BlazorWebView on its own native modal page. The header bar (connection status, connect/disconnect, close) and input bar are native controls — snappier, more reliable, and no longer fighting for z-index territory.
- **Dashboard Overhaul** — The Dashboard got a complete makeover with "At a Glance" cards, embedded release notes, live device monitoring for connected Android and Apple devices, and one-click inspector launch from device cards.
- **Device Monitor Service** — A centralized service that continuously watches for connected Android devices (via ADB) and Apple devices (via `devicectl`), broadcasting changes via mediator events.
- **Push Projects** — A new service for managing push notification project configurations, with backup/restore support and integration into the Push Testing and Firebase Push pages.
- **Android Inspector — Apps Tab** — Browse installed apps on connected Android devices, launch them, or browse their data directories right from the inspector.
- **macOS In-App Auto-Update** — The macOS app can now check for, download, and install updates on its own — no more manual DMG hunts.
- **Debug Failure Simulation** — A toggle on the Debug page that simulates Android SDK build-tools install failures, creating a test scenario for the "Fix with Copilot" flow.

### ✨ Improvements

- **Toolbar Search Everywhere** — Toolbar-driven search now works on Emulators, Keystores, and all other list pages with consistent empty-state messaging.
- **Settings Backup Enhancements** — Google identities are now included in backup exports, and the backup/restore flow supports selection metadata and cloud provider configurations.
- **Native Toolbar Integration** — Root Certificate buttons, Settings save/reset, and Backup actions all moved into native toolbar items on macOS, cleaning up the Blazor UI.
- **Identity Pickers on All Platforms** — Apple and Google identity pickers are no longer hidden on Linux and Windows.
- **Sidebar & Window Persistence** — Sidebar width and window size/position persist across app launches on macOS.
- **Dark Mode CSS Polish** — Consistent dark mode styling for native form controls across all platforms.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **dotnet Not Found on Doctor Fix** — Fixed the Doctor page failing to fix workloads because `dotnet` wasn't on the resolved PATH.
- **macOS App Crash on Launch** — Added the missing `com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit` entitlement that caused `xamarin_vm_initialize` to abort.
- **Toolbar Search Per-Keystroke** — macOS toolbar search now uses `NSTextField.TextDidChangeNotification` instead of `NSSearchField.Changed` for real-time filtering.
- **Doctor Workload Dependencies** — Fixed dependency collection to gather from all workload manifests, not just the first one.
- **ADB Path on Windows** — `adb.exe` is now correctly resolved on Windows across all device services.
- **MauiDevFlow in Release Builds** — MauiDevFlow packages are now excluded from Release builds to prevent assembly conflicts in CI.

### 🔧 Infrastructure

- **CI/CD for macOS & Linux** — The GitHub Actions workflow now builds and publishes the native macOS (AppKit) app alongside Mac Catalyst, with signing, notarization, and artifact upload.
- **Windows Title Bar Manager** — A 687-line native title bar manager for Windows, laying groundwork for proper WinUI toolbar integration.
- **Platform.Maui.MacOS 0.2.0-beta.14** — Updated macOS platform packages with modal resize fixes and toolbar visibility improvements.
- **AndroidSdk 0.33.0** — Bumped Android SDK tooling packages.
