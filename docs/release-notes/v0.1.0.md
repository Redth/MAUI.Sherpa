## 🏔️ v0.1.0 — "Picking Out Supplies"

Every great expedition starts at base camp, rummaging through gear and making sure you've got everything you need before the climb. Consider **MAUI Sherpa** your trusty outfitter for .NET MAUI development — helping you inventory, organize, and prepare all your dev tools so you're not stuck halfway up the mountain wondering where you left your crampons.

This first release is all about getting the pack loaded up:

### 🩺 MAUI Doctor
Before you hit the trail, you need a health check. Doctor scans your development environment — .NET SDKs, workloads, dependencies — and tells you what's missing, what's broken, and offers to fix it on the spot. Think of it as your pre-climb physical.

### 📦 Android SDK Management
Browse, search, and install Android SDK packages without ever opening a terminal. Platform tools, build tools, system images — all the gear, neatly organized on the shelf.

### 📱 Android Emulators
Spin up emulators, manage snapshots, tweak configurations. Your virtual base camps, ready when you are.

### 🍎 Apple Developer Tools *(macOS)*
Certificates, provisioning profiles, bundle IDs, device registration — the bureaucratic paperwork of Apple development, made slightly less painful. Like filling out your climbing permits, but with fewer forms.

### 🤖 GitHub Copilot Integration
An AI sherpa for your sherpa. Ask questions, get help with environment setup, and receive suggestions — right inside the app.

### 🏠 Dashboard
Your base camp overview. One glance at the state of your environment before you set out.

*We're still at the trailhead — the summit is a long way off. But hey, you can't climb Everest without first picking out the right pair of boots.* 🥾
