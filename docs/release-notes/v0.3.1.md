## 🏔️ v0.3.1 — "Checking the Gear"

A quick stop at Camp I to tighten a few straps. The Windows builds now pack everything they need — .NET runtime, Windows App SDK, the whole kit — so there's nothing to install on the target machine. We've also added arm64 builds for the Surface climbers in the group.

### 🔧 Infrastructure

- **Fully Self-Contained Windows Builds** — Windows releases now bundle both the .NET runtime (`--self-contained`) and Windows App SDK, so the app runs on any Windows machine with zero prerequisites. Just unzip and go.
- **ARM64 Windows Support** — CI now publishes both `win-x64` and `win-arm64` builds. Copilot+ PCs and Surface Pro X get native binaries instead of running under emulation.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Secrets Nav Highlight** — Fixed the Secrets nav item lighting up when viewing the Publish sub-page. Each trail marker now points to exactly one destination.

*Still acclimatizing at Camp I — but the gear check is done and everything fits.* 🎒
