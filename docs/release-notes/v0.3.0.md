## 🏔️ v0.3.0 — "Establishing Camp I"

The approach march is over and the real climbing begins. This release plants a proper camp above the glacier — **secrets management**, **selective backups**, and **Windows platform support** give the expedition the infrastructure it needs for the harder terrain ahead. The pack is lighter, the gear is organized, and the route above is finally clear.

### 🆕 New Features

- **Secrets Management** — A full secrets vault with provider-backed storage (Infisical, Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager). Browse, create, edit, and publish secrets to CI/CD pipelines — your valuables, stashed safely at altitude.
- **Secrets Publishing** — Push secrets directly to GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, GitLab CI, and Bitbucket Pipelines from a single publish page. No more juggling provider dashboards.
- **Selective Backup Export/Import** — Granular per-item checkboxes let you pick exactly which settings, identities, cloud providers, and CI/CD publishers to include in encrypted backups. Pack only what you need for the next camp.
- **Windows Certificate Store** — Browse, inspect, and manage certificates from the Windows certificate store alongside Apple certificates. The expedition now covers both flanks of the mountain.

### ✨ Improvements

- **Editable SDK & JDK Paths** — SDK and JDK path fields are now directly editable for quick copy/paste, instead of requiring the file picker every time.
- **Copilot Tool Output Collapsing** — Tool call outputs in the Copilot chat are now collapsible with bash syntax highlighting. Cleaner conversations, less scroll fatigue.
- **Process Modal Layout** — Improved spacing and shell helper in process execution modals for a more polished terminal experience.
- **Doctor Preview SDK Handling** — Preview .NET SDK versions are now properly detected and handled so the Doctor page gives accurate guidance.
- **Standardized Artifact Names** — CI artifacts follow a consistent naming convention across platforms.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Android SDK Progress Bar Parsing** — Fixed the upstream `AndroidSdk` library (0.30.0) so `sdkmanager` progress bars and diagnostic output are no longer parsed as SDK packages. No more mysterious `;`-separated loading symbols in your package list.
- **Certificate Expiry Dates** — Certificates now show their actual expiry dates instead of always displaying today + 1 year.
- **Apple Identity State** — Identity picker now compares the full identity value (including KeyId and IssuerId) so edits and imports are reflected immediately without restart.
- **Copilot Connection Errors** — Improved error handling when the Copilot SDK connection drops, with updated SDK to 0.1.23.
- **Bundle ID Platform Note** — Added a Mac Catalyst platform note to the Register Bundle ID dialog so you know what you're signing up for.

### 🔧 Infrastructure

- **Windows CI Build** — Added a dedicated Windows build job to the CI workflow so both platforms are tested on every push.
- **Windows Publish Fix** — Corrected the publish configuration per official MAUI docs so Windows releases actually work.
- **MauiDevFlow 0.8.0** — Bumped the AI debugging toolkit and removed legacy config files.
- **AndroidSdk 0.30.0** — Upstream dependency bump with the sdkmanager parsing fix.
- **Platform Guards** — Added `IsSupported` checks to simulator, device, and log services so Windows doesn't try to call Mac-only tools.
