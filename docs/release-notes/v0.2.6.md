## 🏔️ v0.2.6 — "Reading the Map Correctly"

Turns out the compass fix from v0.2.5 only recalibrated the upstream gear — the trail map in our own pack had the same misprint. Now all our navigation instruments agree on which way is north.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **JDK Detection on Mac Catalyst (for real this time)** — MauiSherpa's own `OpenJdkSettingsService` was also using `RuntimeInformation.IsOSPlatform(OSPlatform.OSX)`, which returns `false` on Mac Catalyst. Switched to `OperatingSystem.IsMacOS() || OperatingSystem.IsMacCatalyst()` so JDK paths like `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/` are actually searched. The Doctor page now correctly shows "JDK 21 found."
- **.NET SDK Path Detection on Mac Catalyst** — Same platform check fix applied to `LocalSdkService` so .NET SDK discovery also works correctly under Mac Catalyst.
