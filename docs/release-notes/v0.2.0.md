## 🏔️ v0.2.0 — "Leaving Base Camp"

The packs are loaded, the weather window is open, and it's time to move. This release is where **MAUI Sherpa** steps off the well-worn trail and into serious terrain — new device inspectors, keystore management, simulator tooling, and an auto-updater to keep your gear current while you climb. If v0.1.0 was picking out supplies, v0.2.0 is the first real day on the mountain.

### 🆕 New Features

- **iOS Simulator Management** — A full simulator page with a tabbed inspector: browse installed apps, stream logs, capture screenshots, and run tools like KML route playback — all from one window.
- **Android Keystore Management** — Create, inspect, and export Android keystores with PEPK support for Play Store uploads. View signatures, manage JDK paths, and sync keystores to the cloud.
- **Android Device Inspector** — Pop open any connected device or emulator and get tabbed access to logcat, a file explorer, an interactive shell, screen capture, and device tools like GPS simulation.
- **iOS Device Tools** — Physical device management with a tools tab for simulators and real hardware — install apps, simulate locations, and capture screenshots.
- **Logcat Viewer** — A dedicated, filterable log viewer for Android devices with color-coded severity levels and real-time streaming.
- **Auto-Update** — MAUI Sherpa now checks GitHub Releases for new versions and offers one-click updates so you're never stuck on the mountain with outdated gear.
- **KML/GPX Route Playback** — Simulate GPS routes on emulators and simulators by loading KML or GPX files. Great for testing location-aware apps without leaving your desk.
- **Debug UI Testing Page** — A new `/debug` page for exercising modals, toasts, dialogs, and loading indicators during development.

### ✨ Improvements

- **CI Secrets Export Overhaul** — Refactored the secrets export UI with a cleaner publish flow and better spacing.
- **Modal Keyboard Navigation** — Focus trapping, Tab/Shift+Tab cycling, and Escape-to-close for all modals via JS interop — because hybrid apps need a little extra help.
- **Compact Card Actions** — Icon-only buttons with dropdowns replace the old button sprawl on cards, saving space and looking sharper.
- **Open in Finder/Explorer** — Right from the app, jump to files and directories in your native file manager.
- **Dark Mode Polish** — Theme color improvements across multi-operation modals, file columns, and inspector windows.
- **Text Selection Prevention** — Global `user-select: none` keeps the hybrid app feeling native, with selective re-enable on code blocks and inputs.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Bundle ID Creation** — Fixed platform option handling and empty SeedId issues when registering new bundle IDs.
- **TCC Permission Popup** — Resolved the macOS Documents permission dialog that appeared on startup by using the correct app data path.
- **Mac Catalyst File Picker** — Switched to `DidPickDocumentAtUrls` (plural) which actually fires on modern Mac Catalyst.
- **Debug Keychain Fallback** — Debug builds now always use file-based fallback storage instead of fighting with Keychain signature mismatches.
- **Certificate Serial Matching** — Upgraded the App Store Connect client and normalized serial numbers to handle Apple's leading-zero inconsistencies.
- **Data Migration** — Fixed migration logic to prefer newer files and corrected device button layout alignment.

### 🔧 Infrastructure

- **MauiDevFlow 0.5.2** — Bumped the AI debugging toolkit for improved CDP and agent support.
- **Release Notes Skill** — Added a project-level skill for generating these very release notes. Meta? Absolutely.
- **Docs & Screenshots** — Expanded AGENTS.md, reorganized screenshots, and added comprehensive documentation.
