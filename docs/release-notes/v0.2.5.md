## 🏔️ v0.2.5 — "Tuning the Compass"

Small adjustments on the trail — recalibrating instruments so they read true. A couple of display fixes and an upstream gear swap to make sure the JDK compass actually points north on Mac Catalyst.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **JDK Detection on Mac Catalyst** — Bumped the upstream `AndroidSdk` library to 0.28.0, which fixes `JdkLocator` not finding JDKs on Mac Catalyst. The old platform check (`RuntimeInformation.IsOSPlatform(OSPlatform.OSX)`) returns `false` on Mac Catalyst — the new version also checks `OperatingSystem.IsMacCatalyst()`.

### ✨ Improvements

- **Version SHA Trimming** — Version strings with long commit SHAs (e.g., `0.2.4+abc123def456...`) are now trimmed to 8 characters in both the Update Available dialog and the Settings page. Easier on the eyes.
- **Update Dialog Bullet Padding** — Improved list padding in the "What's New" release notes content so bullet points aren't jammed against the edge.
