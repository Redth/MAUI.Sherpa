## 🏔️ v0.4.0 — "New Routes"

Camp I is behind us and the team is pushing upward. This release opens several new routes on the mountain — push notification testing for both iOS and Firebase, a proper Google Identity locker, and 1Password integration for cloud secrets. More trails, more tools, more altitude.

### 🆕 New Features

- **iOS Push Testing** — Send APNs push notifications straight from Sherpa. Pick a certificate, target a device token, choose your environment, and fire away — no `curl` gymnastics required.
- **Firebase Push Testing** — Same deal for FCM. Compose messages with optional title, image, custom data, and topic routing — all from a dedicated page with live response feedback.
- **Google Identity Management** — Store and manage Google Service Account credentials alongside your Apple identities. Import via file browse or paste the JSON directly. Firebase Push picks up your selected identity automatically.
- **1Password Cloud Secrets** — 1Password joins Infisical as a cloud secrets provider. Connect a vault, sync keystores and signing secrets through the `op` CLI, all managed from Settings.

### ✨ Improvements

- **Push Pages Styling** — Section headers on the push testing pages got a proper card treatment with themed backgrounds, borders, and consistent spacing.
- **Copilot CLI Fallback** — The embedded Copilot now resolves its CLI binary through multiple paths — bundled runtime, RID fallback, and system PATH — so it works even when the app bundle packaging gets creative.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Copilot Overlay Crash** — Opening the Copilot overlay no longer triggers a Blazor error when the CLI binary isn't found. A missing catch block let the exception bubble up and crash the UI.
- **Certificate Sync Improvements** — Certificate sync service handles edge cases more gracefully with additional test coverage.

*The route is getting steeper and the air a little thinner, but the view from here? Totally worth the climb.* 🧗
