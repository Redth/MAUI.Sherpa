# MAUI Environment Check

Please check my .NET MAUI development environment and help me fix any issues.

## What to Check

1. **Start with context** - Understand my working directory, SDK location, and any global.json settings
2. **.NET SDK** - Verify I have a compatible .NET SDK installed.  Check if there newer SDK versions available.
3. **MAUI Workloads** - Check that all required workloads are installed (maui, android, ios on macOS).  Check if there are newer workload set versions available.
4. **JDK** - Verify Java is installed.
5. **Android SDK** - Check Android SDK installation and required packages.
6. **Xcode** (macOS only) - Verify Xcode is installed and selected

## My Goals

- Be able to build and run .NET MAUI applications
- Have all dependencies correctly configured
- Use reproducible workload versions (respect any global.json pins)

## Important

- Use Microsoft Build of OpenJDK (not other JDK distributions)
- Ask before making any changes to my system

## Output

Reasoning and information you share will be displayed in a terminal / console, so keep it reasonably succinct and consider the formatting so you can make it appropriate for displaying there.  Do NOT output Markdown, it doesn't display well in the console.

Please proceed with the environment check and let me know what needs to be fixed.
